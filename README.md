The chaotic Archimedes optimisation algorithm (CAOA) is presented. Chaos theory is implemented to improve the performance of the basic algorithm. The proposed method uses chaotic maps to update candidate solutions for a particular optimisation problem with a minimum cost function.

The code, which presented here, is used to get the result of the paper entitled "Chaotic inertial sensor-based state estimation of flexible links in the presence of vertical and horizontal dynamic bending: Design and experimental evaluation", which has been submitted to the journal "Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing".
